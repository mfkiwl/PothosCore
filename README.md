# Pothos framework library and build environment

This is the project for the Pothos framework library.
It also contains submodules for various dependencies
and Pothos toolkits to make it easy to install
the entire Pothos software suite in one build.

## Documentation

* https://github.com/pothosware/PothosCore/wiki

## Build Status

- Travis: [![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pothosware/PothosCore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pothosware/PothosCore)
- AppVeyor: [![AppVeyor Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/7owo8qb9oldw8iq8)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/guruofquality/pothos)

## Dependencies

The poco, muparserx, and spuce libraries are available
as git submodules to simplify building this project from source.
The user may install these dependencies separately prior to building,
or the build will install them automatically from submodule if missing.

* poco C++ utility library (framework+toolkit dependency)
* muparserx expression parser (framework dependency)
* spuce filter design library (toolkit dependency)

## Toolkits

Although all toolkits can be built as standalone cmake projects,
user may wish to build these toolkits alongside the framework
library to simplfy the effort involved building from source.
The following toolkits are available as git submodules:

* PothosAudio
* PothosBlocks
* PothosComms
* PothosFlow
* PothosPlotters
* PothosPython
* PothosSoapy
* PothosWidgets

## Building

configure, build, and install with CMake

## Layout

* include/ - public API C++11 header files
* lib/ - C++ sources for the Pothos library
* docs/ - doxygen configuration and generation
* apps/ - the source for the PothosUtil binary
* cmake/ - cmake utilities for building projects
